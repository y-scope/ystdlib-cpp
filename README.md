ystdlib-cpp
===================================
An open-source C++ library developed and used at YScope.

# Usage
Clone `ystdlib-cpp` into your project. Then, in your project's `CMakeLists.txt`, add the following:
```cmake
add_subdirectory(/path/to/ystdlib-cpp EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)
target_link_libraries(<target_name> <link_options>
    ystdlib::<lib_1> ystdlib::<lib_2> ... ystdlib::<lib_N>
	# other libs...
)
```
Ensure that `ystdlib-cpp` is either within a subdirectory of the folder containing `CMakeLists.txt`
or at the same level.
